He is the giver of food to the people, for practical purposes. A farmer is someone who owns and operates a farm. Some farmers grow a range of crops, while others produce dairy cows and sell their milk. Farmers labour in agriculture in some capacity, such as growing vegetables, grains, or fruit, or raising animals for milk, eggs, or meat.
